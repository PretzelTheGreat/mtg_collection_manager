# MTG Collection Manager

This is a personal project i've started to create an "all-in-one" solution to manage my magic the gathering collection

## Features

### Pricing info

By using MTGJSON's (https://mtgjson.com/) data, I've created a way to generate a local database of relatively up to date pricing info from major online card marketplaces, making it easier to lookup pricing info about cards in my collection

### Deck Manager

By using json formatting for my decks, i have a programatic way to import the decklists and work with them in my program

### Collection Manager

This will be used to manage all the cards in my collection, to include keeping track of the cards that are currently being used in my decks

### Collection Valuation

By using the pricing info database, I can create a full valuation for my collection, and filter by only rares/mythics or the collection as a whole (in case there are some uncommons or commons that are going for more than $2.00 USD)
